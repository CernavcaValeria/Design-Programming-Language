# Design-Programming-Language
Design an original programming language and provide a syntactic analyzer for it, using YACC.

New programming language include:
    ● predefined types: int, float, char, string, bool 
    ● user defined data types (similar to classes in object orientated languages, but with own syntax);
      provide specific syntax to allow initialization and use of variables of these types
    ● array types
    ● variable declarations/definition, constant definitions
    ● control statements (if, for, while, etc.), assignment statements
    ● function declarations
    ● arithmetic and boolean expressions
    ● operations with string types
    ● function calls which can have as parameters: expressions, other function calls,identifiers, constants, etc.
